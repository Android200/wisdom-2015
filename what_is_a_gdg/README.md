# GDG Chapters

## What is GDG?

Google Developer Groups (GDGs) are for developers who are interested in Google's developer technology; everything from the [Android](http://code.google.com/android), [App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/), and [Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/chrome/) platforms, to product APIs like the [Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/) and [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/).

A GDG can take many forms -- from just a few people getting together to watch our [latest video](http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers), to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to events like code sprints and hackathons. However, at the core, GDGs are focused on developers and technical content, and the core audience should be developers.

* A place to learn about [Google Technologies and Tools](https://developers.google.com/products/) for developers.
* A place to see what local companies and developers are doing with these technologies
* Focused on developers and educational technical content
* Open to the public with a public membership
* A place to meet cool and smart people in tech :)

##A GDG is NOT...

* A place to hear a very salesy pitch at any time
* Focused on end users or consumer content
* A closed group
