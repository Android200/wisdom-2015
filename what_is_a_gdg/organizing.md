### How to engage members as co-organizers?
Sharing work helps to keep organizing fun and the success rewards your co-organizers.

Members that you like to work with can be potential co-organizers. Organize an informal meeting to explain the whole structure of GDGs! Explain who is the global contact at Google, who is the regional contact at Google.

Together prepare a list of possible locations for events, possible sponsors.

Make a plan for the next two or three events and work the co-organizers through the steps for organizing an event.

###Check list 
* Give access to the registration service for events (meetup.com/eventbrite/google form)

* Promote members to managers in the G+ chapter community or Facebook group (if exists)
* Give access to documents at Google drive, etc. about previous events
* Give access to other social media
