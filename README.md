This is a Google Developer Groups (GDG) created *living document* that is community-owned, multi-lingual, and publicly accessible.

The goal is to collect and curate knowledge that can help GDG organizers run and manage their community, events, activities and partnerships.

Itâ€™s not intended as a repository of technical content or Google product information, with the exception of tips and ideas for technical areas to cover by our activities.
