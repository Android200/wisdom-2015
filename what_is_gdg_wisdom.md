**GDG Wisdom** is an initiative to collect, organize and share useful knowledge (best practices, tips, resources and references) for creating, organizing and growing the Google Developer Groups community. All content here is created and owned by the [Google Developers Group Community](https://developers.google.com/community/) and open to the whole world under [Creative Commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) (note: the exact CC license is yet to be determined).

The original GDG Wisdom repository was envisioned as a [website](https://sites.google.com/site/gdgwisdom/home) that was maintained by a core group of Wisdom Keepers. However, this faced some challenges in maintaining relevance, attribution and effiency in converting community contributions to site updates.

In 2015, we made the decision to move to GitHub and established a [GDG Wisdom Organization] (https://github.com/gdg-wisdom) to oversee GitHub-based content repositories. We also made the decision to move to using the [GitBook](http://www.gitbook.com) content authoring and publishing platform and created an associated [GDG Wisdom](gdg-wisdom.gitbooks.io/) account for publishing our content there.

GitBook allows authors to write their manuscripts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and automatically generates both a responsive web page and multiple e-book formats (PDF, mobi, ePub) for convenient distribution and consumption of that content. GitBook content is backed by a GitHub repository, with webhooks that automatically trigger a rebuild of the book every time the associated GitHub repository is updated.

GDG Wisdom is overseen by members of the [GDG Task Force](https://plus.google.com/communities/105665179823281944523) community who have direct commit rights to the GitHub project.
